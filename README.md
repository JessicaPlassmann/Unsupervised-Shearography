# Unsupervised Learning for Shearography-Based Defect Detection

This repository serves as a central collection point for data, code, and results related to our ongoing research on the **automated evaluation of shearographic measurement data**, with a particular focus on **unsupervised** and **weakly supervised learning** approaches.

We aim to explore and evaluate methods that reduce or eliminate the need for manual labeling in the context of defect detection using shearography.

## Repository Scope

The repository is structured to support a growing set of contributions in this research direction. It includes:

- A curated dataset of shearographic image data
- Representative image samples categorized by structure and defect presence
- Code used in our publications and experiments
- Scripts and models for unsupervised and weakly supervised learning tasks

New modules and datasets may be added in the future as this line of research evolves.

## Note to Reviewers

> This repository contains materials related to our **SGAI 2025 submission** on unsupervised learning for shearographic data.  
>
> The full dataset and source code will be made public upon paper acceptance to ensure transparency and reproducibility.  
>
> If early access is required for the purpose of reviewing or further clarification, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. My contact information is included in the submitted manuscript and I am happy to provide the necessary materials upon request.
