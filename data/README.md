## Dataset Acquisition

The shearographic data were acquired using a shearography sensor from Tenta Vision GmbH, which was mounted on a UR5 industrial robot arm (Universal Robots) to enable automated measurements.  

The measurement procedure employed spatial phase-shifting shearography, with a shear value of 1 mm oriented at a 45° angle relative to the specimen surface.  
Illumination was applied at a 0° angle, i.e., perpendicular to the specimen surface.  

The dataset comprises shearographic images recorded both with and without phase fringe patterns, including samples from defect-free as well as defective specimens.  
For selected defective samples, corresponding annotation files in JSON format are provided, detailing the location and nature of defects.

A comprehensive description of the measurement setup and acquisition protocol is provided in the associated SGAI 2025 publication.
